Hi, my name is Joshua I am currently a computer science major at FIU with a focus on data. I enjoy working with SQL and python mostly. Largely because of the flexibility
that it offers, python is a powerful do it all language that allows us to do some incredible things in my case its mostly automation, data storage, data manipulation and data 
visualization with pandas, seaborne, numpy, and matpilotlib. These libaries and this language unlocked a whole new world for me, and I hope i can share it with you all as i continue
to build and learn. I mentioned SQL a little earlier, I also spend a good amount of time filtering through information using SQL, it unlocks a whole new world of information that once 
we learn to navigate(through SQL) leaves me in utter amazement. Combine that witht he ability to build visual aids using tableau, PowerBI and Power Point we're able to see a completly 
different side of reality. But, thats just the tip of the ice berg once we understand the story that data tells us we can start to usethat information to predict future events, this 
is where machine learning comes into play. Machine learning is the futre and understanding the role data plays is key to that future. Did you know that ChatGPT, Bard and AutoGPT were
all built using a bit of python code ? did you know that language is also responsible for some of the video games we enjoy on a routine basis, and can even be used to automate most tasks ?
Im getting a bit ahead of myself but regardless python is incredibly powerful and im looking forward to using this as a way to document my work/progress with both python and SQL.
